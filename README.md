## Challenge Breakdown

2. Show grid using canvas
3. Randomise grid cells to either zero or one.
4. Show green for living cells (one) and empty for dead cells (zero).
5. Somehow identify the 8 neighbouring cells around each cell (can already tell will give me a hard time).
6. Resolve out-of-bound neighbour cells.
7. Give a total score of living based on the neighbourhood of each cell.
8. Apply the rules of life to each cell factoring its total neighbourhood score.
9. Figure out how to setup generation changes for each cell.
   (maybe use requestAnimationFrame or a while loop for that?)
